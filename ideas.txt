- Retail Monkey
- Groq (maybe)


Overall idea:
- Create a website using freedomain (mlh domain)
- Advanced Password Manager with Encryption 


	Features:
		- Use AI to create advanced passwords
		- Use AI to rate password on score 
			- UI with some bar on a score of 10 (complete UI challenge)

		- Be able to parse breached data and return if data breached
			- Should parse through a giant txt file, storing data in MySQL
			- Have a front-end where users are able to prompt/check if their data has been breached
			- 

		- Use Retail Monkey to create feedback form 
			- some contact form/page with SurveyMonkey

		- See if we can utilize Gadget
		
		- Cool lock idea:
			- Depending on the strength rating of the password, a locked lock will rattle (the higher the rating the more rattling), if the password
			is strong the lock will rattle a little, if it is very weak, it will rattle vigirously and unlock, showing the password is unsafe to use.


Assignments:
- Agam works on UI
- Rayyan works on Data processing of txt file (and updating database)
- Aashir works on (Groq?) to create advanced passwords/rate on a score of 10
- Prad works on the Retail
